# Introduction
This project focuses on applying core cryptographic principles to enhance data confidentiality within an AWS environment. The central objective is to secure files hosted on an Amazon EC2 instance by implementing encryption and decryption workflows aligned with data protection standards. By configuring the AWS Encryption CLI and utilizing AWS Key Management Service (KMS), the solution enables users to create encryption keys, encrypt plaintext files, and securely decrypt ciphertext. Through this hands-on implementation, the project demonstrates a proactive approach to safeguarding sensitive information using AWS-native services.
Key Objectives:
- Generate and manage encryption keys with AWS KMS
- Set up and use the AWS Encryption CLI
- Encrypt plaintext and decrypt ciphertext
